# Take Care

Take Care is a full-stack JavaScript mobile application meant for tracking productivity and goals.  

It can be difficult to concentrate on tasks, especially when there are several to complete or the tasks are large.  One can easily feel overwhelmed and forget to take a break once in a while to recharge mentally and emotionally.  The premise of Take Care is to help one visualize and manage his or her goals while also serving as a positive reinforcement.  Take Care is meant to help one not only take care of tasks, but more importantly to take care of oneâ€™s mental and emotional health.
