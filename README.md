# Take Care

Take Care is a full-stack mobile application meant for tracking productivity and goals.  This application is built with a React.js and JavaScript front-end and a PHP/MySQL back-end.

It can be difficult to concentrate on tasks, especially when there are several to complete or the tasks are large.  One can easily feel overwhelmed and forget to take a break once in a while to recharge mentally and emotionally.  The premise of Take Care is to help one visualize and manage his or her goals while also serving as a positive reinforcement.  Take Care is meant to help one not only take care of tasks, but more importantly to take care of oneâ€™s mental and emotional health.
